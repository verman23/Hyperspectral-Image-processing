# hyperspectral-image-classification
This code is designed for performing classification of hyperspectral image data and visualizing the results. Hyperspectral images are multi-dimensional data sets. The code focuses on the classification of hyperspectral data into different categories or classes, and it provides visualizations to help assess the quality of the classification results.


This classification also works on many data sets such as Houston 2013, Houston 2018, University of Pavia (UP) and Pavia Center (PC) and Indian Pines.

We created this project in Jupyter notebook and in this project we have used many libraries like Keras, Sklaran, Numpy, Scipy and Spectral libraries.
We saved the output images as prediction images.

This is the output image of Houston 2013 data
